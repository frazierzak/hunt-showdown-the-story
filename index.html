            <strong>It all started with <em>him</em></strong
            >. His blackened fingers gripped the entrinched revolver from the
            mud. Denis Mukwege (born 1955) is a gynaecologist and Pentecostal
            pastor who specializes in the treatment of women in the Democratic
            Republic of the Congo who have been raped by armed rebels. He has
            treated thousands of women who were victims of rape as a weapon of
            war since the Second Congo War, some of them more than once,
            performing up to ten operations a day during 17-hour working days.

          <p>
            On 2018, Mukwege and Iraqi Yazidi human-rights activist Nadia Murad
            were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for "their efforts to end
            the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war and armed conflict".
