          I've opened a door here that I regret. I care deeply for nature. Marry
          me. I don't criticize you! And if you're worried about criticism,
          sometimes a diet is the best defense. No, I did not kill Kitty.
          However, I am going to oblige and answer the nice officer's questions
          because I am an honest man with no secrets to hide.

          No… but I'd like to be asked! I'm afraid I just blue myself. I've
          opened a door here that I regret. Bad news. Andy Griffith turned us
          down. He didn't like his trailer.

          Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. He'll want to use your
          yacht, and I don't want this thing smelling like fish. I care deeply
          for nature. It's called 'taking advantage.' It's what gets you ahead
          in life.

          Well, what do you expect, mother? Bad news. Andy Griffith turned us
          down. He didn't like his trailer. Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of
          toast. There's only one man I've ever called a coward, and that's
          Brian Doyle Murray. No, what I'm calling you is a television actor.
