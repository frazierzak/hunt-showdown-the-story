# hunt-showdown-the-story

Here you'll find all of the collected lore and story elements of the universe in Hunt: Showdown, a videogame developed and published for PC/Console by Crytek. Since the game's 1.0 release in 2018, the story has slowly been revealed through in-game content and events. I found it rather hard to consume all of the amazing bits and pieces of the lore so this project aims to consolidate it. This project is open-sourced any contribution would be highly appreciated.
